- DormistorÃ« is a simple online storefront designed from the Admins point of view.
- The Admin has access to all the inventory, can see details about each product, as well as create new products for the store.
- Future implementations include getting a functional Login page with proper authorization, a functioning shopping cart (integration of a payment library), and development of a "Customer side" page that has all the products displayed in a more user friendly manner.
- We added some personal touches to the site because development is supposed to be fun!

- Front-end was built with React and deployed on Firebase
- Back-end was built with Express, PostgreSQL, Knex and deployed it on herokuapp
